<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p>In the Fall of 1935, President Roosevelt made
the first allotment of funds to the Office of Education
for educational broadcasting. In discussing
the idea, he emphasized the need for programs
that would make more significant the human
struggle to achieve our freedom as safeguarded
by our Constitution; the values of inter-American
understanding and friendship; and the processes
of building a finer and more enduring American
culture by developing a greater appreciation of
the rich heritages that have come to us through
the many races and nationalities which make up
our population.</p>

<p>Hence, the first series, “Let Freedom Ring,”
traced the evolution of human freedom and presented
the contributions which old-world settlers
had made to our conception of civil liberty. Then
came “Brave New World,” portraying the Latin-American
contributions to democracy and to the
general culture of the Americas. In April, 1938,
the President in addressing the Daughters of the
American Revolution unknowingly gave the title
to the series “Americans All—Immigrants All”
when he said, “Remember that all of us are
descended from immigrants.”</p>

<h2>What Brought Us to the United States?</h2>

<div class="blockquote noindent">

<p><i>Have you ever played with a magnet and a bunch of iron filings? Wasn’t it amazing to see the bits of iron leap
across space to reach and cling to the magnet? This story is about a magnet much larger and more powerful than you
have ever imagined—one 3,000 miles long and 1,500 miles wide. A different kind of magnet, too, one that attracted not iron
filings, but human beings, real live people. A magnet that attracted every type and variety of human being alive!
White people, black people, yellow people; Catholics, Protestants, Huguenots, Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, Unitarians,
Jews; Spaniards, Danes, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Bohemians, Italians, Austrians, Slavs, Poles, Roumanians, Russians—and
I’ve only just begun; farmers, miners, adventurers, soldiers, sailors, rich men, poor men, beggar men,
thieves, shoemakers, tailors, actors, musicians, ministers, engineers, writers, singers, ditch-diggers, manufacturers,
butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers. That magnet was AMERICA.—From “We the People”—by</i> <span class="smcap">Leo Huberman</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since the dawn of history, man has been on the move, restlessly
seeking new environments in an effort to satisfy his physical and other
needs. In the main, his wanderings have been local in character, highlighted
by occasional mass migrations which have had a marked effect
upon the history of the world. Among such mass migrations may be
cited the migration of the Israelites from Palestine to Egypt, of the Germanic
tribes into the Roman Empire, of the Saxons and Danes to England,
of the Moors from the north of Africa to Spain, and of the Mongols and
the Tartars from the Orient to Central Asia.</p>

<p>Great as these migrations were and important
as their effect was on the course of history,
they did not compare with the stream
of humanity that began to flow to this
country early in the seventeenth century—a
stream that assumed flood proportions
toward the close of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Not only did the movement of peoples to
our shores differ in magnitude from other
migrations, it also differed in character.
Whereas earlier mass migrations had consisted
of the movements of tribes and distinct
racial groups, the migration to the
New World consisted of men of all races,
nations, and creeds—a pageant of all the
nations.</p>

<h3><i>Great Historic Freedoms</i></h3>

<p>What motives impelled these people to
uproot themselves from their homelands and
to transplant themselves to a country where
it was necessary to adjust themselves to a
new environment and culture pattern? Many
came for the love of adventure, answering
the challenge of the unknown. Some were
mercenary soldiers seeking new exploits.
Others came because they were friendless
down-and-outers and “ne’er-do-wells,” seeking
a chance to begin life anew. There were
still others, like the Negroes, who although
the majority did not come of their own free will, nevertheless contributed
toil and labor to the making of America.</p>

<p>Commercial enterprise and the hope of economic gain have, of course,
been important factors in the peopling of our country. So also has the search
for freedom. In fact, the cherished moral ideals and objectives of the immigrants
laid the foundations of our democratic ideals. These great historic
freedoms include:</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. <i>Religious liberty</i>—freedom of conscience.</p>

<p>2. <i>Personal and political liberty</i>—freedom from political tyranny and
oppression.</p>

<p>3. <i>Economic liberty</i>—freedom to use brain, brawn, and initiative to earn
the best living possible.</p>

<p>4. <i>Intellectual liberty</i>—freedom of opinion, speech, assembly, and press.</p>

<p>5. <i>Cultural liberty</i>—freedom to establish institutions and to practice
certain traditions and customs.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>search for human freedom</i> can be advanced, with historical warrant,
as the basic reason for the presence in this country of about 130,000,000 people.
Without question, this is the common denominator of our democracy.</p>

<h3><i>Religious Liberty</i></h3>

<p>The vanguard of those seeking refuge from religious persecution arrived
on the Mayflower and settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts. John Winthrop
founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a refuge for Puritans. Maryland,
later on, became the haven for persecuted
Catholics. Rhode Island was founded by
Roger Williams and his group of independent,
religious free thinkers. Here, the
Quakers found a ready welcome and the
Jews, driven out of Europe, were allowed to
build their synagogues. Toward the end of
the seventeenth century, William Penn and
his Quaker followers settled in Pennsylvania
and cultivated the most friendly relationships
with Indians, colonists, and new settlers
alike.</p>

<p>To Manhattan Island and South Carolina
came the French Huguenots, a group of
French Protestants, whose guarantee of religious
liberty had been revoked by the
Edict of Nantes. During the nineteenth century,
one of the early acts of the Mormons
after settling in Utah was to contribute
money toward building a Catholic church.</p>

<h3><i>Personal and Political Liberty</i></h3>

<p>To escape political tyranny and oppression,
thousands of people left their homes
and crossed the Atlantic. Following their
unsuccessful rebellion against the English,
the Irish came in large numbers. So did
the Germans when the Revolution of 1848
failed. Likewise, the Jews left Russia toward
the close of the nineteenth century in order
to escape intolerable conditions.</p>

<p>Among the great champions of personal liberty has been Thomas Paine,
who turned the tide of victory during the Revolutionary War when he
declared, “This is the cause for which we are ready to suffer and to die—Freedom
for ourselves and the rest of the world.” Another outstanding
champion of personal liberty was Carl Schurz, one of the German forty-eighters,
who supported men of principles and worthy causes regardless
of political affiliations.</p>

<h3><i>Economic Liberty</i></h3>

<p>Coupled with other motives, the newcomer has almost always been
imbued with the hope of making a livelihood or of making profits for
himself or for his employers. The first permanent settlement was established
at Jamestown by the London Company to profit from gold mining
and trade. New Hampshire was founded by Georges and Mason for the
purpose of profit from trade and farming. The Carolinas were founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
by a group of nobles for the same purpose. It was a similar motive which
led the Swedes to settle on the Delaware, the Netherlanders to settle on
Manhattan, the English to conquer New Amsterdam, and Berkeley and
Carteret to settle New Jersey.</p>

<p>It was the hope of gain which brought the French to Louisiana and the
Spaniards to Florida, New Mexico, and California. Likewise, at the close
of the nineteenth century, it was the high wages and high standards of
living which attracted the tide of people who poured in from south and
eastern Europe.</p>

<h3><i>Intellectual Liberty</i></h3>

<p>The fight of man to establish freedom of opinion, freedom of speech,
and freedom of assembly is as old as man himself. For the last two hundred
years, his fight for the freedom of the press has been equally important.
Peter Zenger, who founded the <i>New York Weekly Journal</i> in 1733, registered
a great triumph for the freedom of the press when he won his fight against
Governor Cosby of New York. Men of strong principles and ideas have
always clashed with those who would mold them to a definite pattern
and so enslave their minds. In this country, the thoughts and ideas of all
men may be expressed freely and analyzed by everybody.</p>

<h3><i>Cultural Liberty</i></h3>

<p>The United States has been greatly enriched as the result of cultural
liberty. Here, the immigrant has often found the opportunity to practice
and pass on to others those customs and traditions which have been handed
down to him by his ancestors. The Christmas tree, Easter bunny, and New
Year festivities are German in origin. Many of the festivals in California
and the rodeo are Spanish in origin. Singing societies, folk dancing, games,
cookery, and home life have been enriched by customs introduced from
other lands.</p>

<p>Immigration has indeed proved to be a “wind that blows democratic ideas
through the world.”</p>

<h2>The Development of Our Immigration Policy</h2>

<div class="blockquote noindent">

<p>“<i>Those who have come to our shores, representing many kindreds and tongues, have been
welded by common opportunity into a united patriotism.</i>”—<span class="smcap">Franklin D. Roosevelt.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Long</span> before the Revolutionary War, the colonies enacted restrictive immigration
laws. Many of these laws were based on religious prejudices,
which, although somewhat softened in intensity, still existed when the
new nation was born. Fear and consequent hatred of foreigners and foreign
influence were widely prevalent in the early years of the Republic.</p>

<p>John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Patrick Henry, John Jay, and other
prominent statesmen opposed the introduction of aliens into the political
or economic life of the country. Thomas Jefferson believed that natural
expansion of the existing population would be sufficient to meet the
country’s needs. Even George Washington,
in 1794, said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My opinion with respect to emigration,
is that except of useful mechanics
and some particular descriptions of men
or professions, there is no need of encouragement.</p>

</div>

<p>The prevailing spirit found expression in
stringent naturalization laws which, however,
were soon modified.</p>

<h3><i>The Open Door</i></h3>

<p>While the Federal Government was not
unmindful of its inherent right to determine
who might or might not come or
remain within its borders, yet for a hundred
years after the Revolutionary War ended,
the country’s doors were open to all who
chose to enter regardless of race, of physical,
mental, or economic condition, of religious
or political affiliation, or even of moral
character.</p>

<p>An era of comparative tranquillity prevailed
toward immigration until the 1840’s
when a great flood of immigrants focused
hostility against the Germans and Irish, a
feeling which continued until the outbreak
of the Civil War. A strong movement developed
in Congress in favor of regulating
or even limiting immigration. But nothing
came of it. In a message to Congress in 1841, President Tyler gave expression
to a sentiment that grew stronger with the passing of the years. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to come
and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family, and for
the blessings we offer them we require of them to look upon our country
as their country and unite with us in the great task of preserving our
institutions and thereby perpetuating our liberties.</p>

</div>

<p>The open-door policy continued, for Congress was reluctant to abandon
the time-honored belief that the United States had been dedicated at the
beginning as a refuge for the oppressed people of all nations. Such legislation
as was enacted during this period, including three laws for the improvement
of conditions on immigrant-carrying ships, indicated the sympathetic
attitude of Congress toward the incoming multitudes.</p>

<p>Congress again favored the foreign-born by providing that aliens who
had declared an intention to become citizens might enjoy the benefits of
the Homestead Act of 1862. This privilege was later on destined to accelerate
the settlement of public lands in the West.</p>

<p>Because man power in industry and agriculture had been depleted during
the War Between the States, a Federal law to stimulate immigration was
enacted in 1864, but it was soon repealed when peace was restored.</p>

<h3><i>Federal Control</i></h3>

<p>In the absence of federal action, several seaboard States attempted immigration
control but, after many years of effort, the Supreme Court held
that Congress alone had such power. Congress assumed this power in 1882
when it reluctantly passed the first general immigration law which provided
only that idiots, lunatics, persons likely to become a public charge,
and criminals other than political offenders should be denied admission.
This law marked the beginning of a policy of <i>quality selection</i> which
dominated all subsequent legislation.</p>

<p>In 1882, because of Western opposition, Chinese laborers were excluded—a
policy subsequently extended to include practically all Orientals. In 1884,
a law forbidding the importation of foreign labor under contract was
passed but necessary skilled laborers and members of learned professions
were exempted. Thus was Washington’s opinion unwittingly honored.</p>

<p>While Congress was developing a more stringent selective policy, immigration
increased by leaps and bounds with a shift in the incoming tide from
Northern and Western to Southern and Eastern
Europeans. Unable to function economically,
socially, or politically in their home
lands, a steady stream of immigrants was
spreading over the United States in answer to
the demand for unskilled labor. For more than
thirty years, the words of Emma Lazarus,
carved on the pedestal of the Statue of
Liberty, had vital meaning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Give me your tired, your poor,</div>
<div class="verse">Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,</div>
<div class="verse">The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</div>
<div class="verse">Send these, the homeless, the tempest-tost, to me:</div>
<div class="verse">I lift my lamp beside the golden door.</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3><i>Checking the Tide</i></h3>

<p>The endless stream of newcomers, whose
economic and political backgrounds differed
from those of the earlier immigrants, led to
a search for some method of checking the
new immigration. With this end in view, the
application of a literacy test was advocated.
Presidents Cleveland and Taft had vetoed
acts which contained this provision and President
Wilson twice repudiated it. However,
it became part of the General Law of 1917
over presidential objection. In a reference
to the immigrants, President Wilson said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some of the best stuff in America has come out of foreign lands and
some of the best stuff in America is in the men who are naturalized
citizens of the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>In the meantime, during the administration of President Theodore
Roosevelt, a Gentlemen’s Agreement had been made with Japan in 1907,
whereby Japan undertook to check the emigration of Japanese laborers to
the United States.</p>

<p>Immigration from Europe was largely suspended during the World War,
but it rapidly increased thereafter until it was checked by the temporary
Quota Limit Law of 1921 and definitely limited by the permanent Quota
Limit Law of 1924. By this law, immigration was restricted to 150,000
annually, with quotas allotted to the various nations based on the Census
of 1890. In 1929, the quota based on the Census of 1920 went into effect,
bringing the total immigration quota to about 153,000 annually.</p>

<h3><i>Our Present Policy</i></h3>

<p>The theory that America should be a refuge for the oppressed of all
nations has been quite generally honored in shaping our immigration policy.
However, the United States is no longer a refuge for the oppressed peoples
of all the world in the same way as it was in the past.</p>

<p>Our present policy is that immigration shall be limited to a fixed number,
that such immigrants shall be of good character and well disposed toward
American institutions. For, in the words of former President Coolidge:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whether one traces his Americanism back three centuries to the
Mayflower or three years to the steerage is not half so important as
whether his Americanism today is real and genuine. No matter on what
various crafts we came here, we are all now in the same boat.</p>

</div>

<div class="bbox">

<h2>Ourselves and Our Neighbors</h2>

<p>A recent dinner in Chicago with Catholic
friends, whose parents came from Italy, a conference
with a group of 25 cultured Negro men and
women at Chicago University, and a visit in Des
Moines, Iowa, with a close personal friend of mine,
a rabbi, are a few personal experiences which
show in a very real way how a relatively free society
enables us to enrich our lives through fellowship
with men of different races and religions.</p>

<p>In this Nation, to which more than 38,000,000
immigrants have come during the last 120 years,
the struggle of people of all races and of many
creeds <i>has been</i> and <i>is</i> consciously toward the
goal of human understanding and tolerance. This
is an effort to elevate human welfare, irrespective
of race, color, or creed; and to rise to new heights
of civilization with the help of all contributions
to our culture. A distinguishing characteristic
of a true American is that he measures men
of all races and creeds by their achievement,
their honesty of purpose, and their humility.</p>

<h2>The Immigrant and Our Economic Progress</h2>

<div class="blockquote noindent">

<p><i>The greatest wealth of any nation is its people.</i>—<span class="smcap">Allen H. Eaton.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">To paint</span> an adequate picture of the part
which the immigrant has played in the economic
progress of the United States, it would
be necessary, as Rudyard Kipling says, “to splash
at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet’s
hair.” The industrial and agricultural greatness
of the United States has been made possible by
the brawn and brain of the immigrants and their
children.</p>

<h3><i>Cotton</i></h3>

<p>The important part played by the <i>Negro</i> in
the agricultural life of the South is nowhere more
vividly portrayed than by the story of King
Cotton. Cotton production, which amounted to
85,000,000 lb. in 1810, doubled every ten years
for the following three decades. By 1840, two-thirds
of the world’s cotton supply was produced
in the South and, by 1850, cotton valued at
$98,000,000 was raised. In 1937-1938, the United
States produced four times as much cotton as the
rest of the world.</p>

</div>

<p>Much of the credit for this amazing achievement
goes to the <i>Negro</i> whose labor has been the
foundation of our Cotton Kingdom.</p>

<h3><i>Tobacco</i></h3>

<p>The story of tobacco is, too, largely the achievement
of <i>Negro</i> labor. In 1618, the Virginia planters
exported 20 lb. of tobacco, which increased
to 1,500,000 lb. in 1639 and reached a total of
53,000,000 lb. in 1773. In 1937, the United States
raised more than one-fourth of the world’s tobacco
supply.</p>

<p>In addition to his labor in the cotton and
tobacco fields, the <i>Negro</i> has also helped to make
profitable the production of rice and sugar.</p>

<h3><i>Railroads</i></h3>

<p>The railroad played a great part in the settling
of the West. With the completion of the Erie
Canal, the <i>Irish</i> transferred their energy and labor
to building tracks for the transcontinental railroad.
The <i>Chinese</i> also labored on the western
end. Today, <i>Irish</i>, <i>Chinese</i>, <i>Italian</i>, and <i>Mexican</i>
laborers help to maintain the railroads. In 1937,
almost one-half the world’s miles of railways
were in our country.</p>

<h3><i>Automobiles</i></h3>

<p>Natural resources and inventive genius have enabled
us to produce each year three times as
many automobiles as the rest of the world put
together. The work of the <i>Poles</i>, <i>Slavs</i>, <i>Mexicans</i>,
and other groups has been an important factor
in this phenomenal growth.</p>

<h3><i>Steel</i></h3>

<p>Early colonial iron mills were operated by the
<i>Germans</i>, whose muskets, made in Nazareth, Pa.,
were used by the continental troops. In later
years, the <i>Poles</i> and <i>Slavs</i> have labored in the
great steel mills of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,
and New York. It is the endurance and physical
heritage of these sturdy people that have made it
possible for us to lead the world in the production
of steel.</p>

West Virginia. These, together with the <i>English</i>,
<i>Irish</i>, <i>Germans</i>, <i>Poles</i>, and <i>Slavs</i>, have made us

<h3><i>Farming</i></h3>

<p>Our debt to the <i>German</i> farmer is great, for
he made the wilderness blossom in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri. To Minnesota
and surrounding states came the <i>Swedes</i>,
<i>Norwegians</i>, and <i>Finns</i> with their advanced cooperative
methods and the <i>Danes</i> with their dairy
methods.... Sturdy <i>Czechs</i> farmed Nebraska and
Iowa. The <i>Swiss</i> in Wisconsin helped us to become
the greatest cheesemakers in the world. The
<i>Russians</i> brought us important seed varieties of
wheat, rye, oats, buckwheat, sunflowers, and
millet.</p>

<p><i>Finns</i> and <i>French-Canadians</i> in the lumber
camps of Maine and Washington have made it
possible for us to produce more than 24 million
board feet of lumber in one year.... <i>Portuguese</i>
are prominent in the New England fisheries as
are the <i>Finns</i> on the Pacific Coast.... The <i>Greeks</i>
have developed a flourishing sponge industry in
Florida.... <i>Italians</i> are engaged in the marble
quarries of Vermont and on truck farms of New
Jersey and California.</p>

<div class="blockquote noindent">

<p><i>America is made up of the cultural strains of many countries. The mere knowledge of this
matchless wealth is an inspiration to anyone who knows it.</i>—<span class="smcap">Allen H. Eaton.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Nature</span> has blessed this country with great
natural wealth, but immigration has
brought us even greater riches in the form
of human resources. Andrew Carnegie, himself
an immigrant, was well aware of this when he
said, “Take away my factories, my railroads, my
ships. Take away my money, strip me of all
these things, but leave me my men, and in two
or three years, I will have everything back again.”</p>

<h3><i>Priceless Gifts</i></h3>

<p>Transforming her immigrants as they have
come, the United States has, in turn, been enriched
and transformed by them. The immigrant
has played an important part in our cultural
as well as in our economic life. One immigrant,
Franklin K. Lane, who became Secretary of the
Interior, wrote feelingly of the contributions
which the immigrant has made to American life.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Their music—dirge and dance and wassail
song, proud march and religious chant, and
their instruments for the making of music.</p>

<p>Their poetry—winged tales of man’s many
passions, folk songs and psalm, ballads of
heroes and tunes of the sea, lilting scraps
caught from the sky and field, or mighty
dramas that tell of primal struggles of the
profoundest meaning.</p>

<p>Their art—fancies of the mind, woven in
wood or wool, silk, stone, or metal, rugs and
baskets, gates of fine design and modeled
gardens, houses and walls, pillars, roofs, windows,
statues and painting—their art and
handcraft.</p>

<p>Homelike familiar things—a favorite tree or
fruit, an accustomed flower, a style in cookery
or in costume.</p>

<p>Hands with which to work.</p>

<p>Minds that could conceive.</p>

<p>Hearts filled with home—stout hearts to
drive live minds; live minds to direct willing
hands.</p>

</div>

<p>Irish song and wit, German thrift and industry,
Scottish virility and genius, English love of law
and order, Scandinavian honesty and love of
home, Negro fervor in song and story, Mexican
enjoyment of life, Indian customs and traditions,
Slavic dance and folk song, neatness and thoroughness
of the Netherlanders, Italian love for
art and music, and philosophic tendencies of the
Oriental for the beautiful, are but a few of the
strands that may be found woven into our national
pattern.</p>

<h3><i>The Art of Living Together</i></h3>

<p>Barriers that once existed between racial and
national groups in this country are fast disappearing.
Cooperative effort and healthy respect
are taking their place. We are “learning to understand
other peoples to understand ourselves.”
The newcomers brought with them an ardent
desire to improve their conditions. They quickly
availed themselves of the opportunity which the
public school offered them.</p>

<p>The school took “the child of the exile of
Hungary, of the half-starved emigrant from the
Emerald Isle, and of the hardy Norwegian, and
placed them on the same bench with the offspring
of those whose ancestors’ bones bleached upon
the fields of Lexington.” The library, the church,
the motion picture, and radio are also powerful
educational agencies in molding the pattern of
the New American.</p>

<h3><i>Milestones of Progress</i></h3>

<p>The immigrant has always been a firm devotee
of the ideals of democracy, for in most cases he
has suffered religious, political, military, or other
oppression. Even in the United States, democracy
did not begin full tilt. But, just as the frontier
has been conquered, so too the areas of human
rights and freedoms have been extended.</p>

<p>The abolition of slavery, universal suffrage, the
grant of full rights of citizenship to women, labor
legislation, and property rights have all been
milestones in the onward march of democracy.</p>

<p>The immigrant has not been unmindful of the
blessings conferred upon him in this country.
He has adjusted himself quickly to his new environment.
In every crisis, he has faithfully stood
by our country and institutions. He has striven
to teach his children to love and honor the land
which harbors them.</p>

<p>All human history teaches us that the price
of human liberty is the continuous enlargement
of that liberty. The only safe principle of democracy
is justice, equity, and equal respect among
all our people. Great unfinished tasks remain for
us to solve. Our common loyalty must hold high
the torch and pass it on, with fire unquenched,
to the citizen of tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Are People Really Different?</h2>

<div class="blockquote noindent">

<p>“<i>Democracy means not ‘I’m as good as you are’ but ‘you’re as good as I am.’</i>”—<span class="smcap">Theodore Parker.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Immigration</span> has made the United States the
most composite nation on earth. More peoples
of widely different national and racial origins
have been brought together and welded into a
single political, economic, and social system than
anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>What constitutes a race? Does each race have
certain hereditary characteristics which determine
its mental life and social behavior? Is
there a racial stock which is superior—physically,
mentally, and morally—to other racial stocks?
Just what differences, if any, exist between those
who were born here and those who have adopted
this country as their home land?</p>

<p>There is no such person as a native American,
nor was there ever such a person if we are to be
strictly accurate. We are told that even the American
Indian is an immigrant who came from far-off
Asia by way of the Bering Straits and Alaska.
Our ancestors may have come on the Mayflower
or in the steerage, we may be descended from
immigrants who settled here generations ago, or
we may have come direct from other lands, yet
one fact remains crystal clear—WE ARE ALL
IMMIGRANTS.</p>

<h3><i>Physical Characteristics</i></h3>

<p>From the physical standpoint, races do have
certain very definite differences that are obvious.
One of the most obvious is that of color.
White, black, yellow, red, brown, and yellow-brown
are the colors we usually associate with
certain racial types. Some of us are tall, blond,
and blue-eyed. Others are short, dark, and brown-eyed.
Some people have long, narrow heads while
others have short, round heads. However, the
same physical differences may be found not only
between racial and national groups, but also
between individuals within the nation, tribe, or
family.</p>

<h3><i>Mental Characteristics</i></h3>

<p>In answer to the contention that certain racial
groups are mentally superior to others, Franz
Boas, an outstanding scientist, says, “No one has
ever proved that a human being through his
descent from a group of people must of necessity
have certain mental characteristics.... If
we were to select the most intelligent, imaginative,
energetic, and emotionally stable third of
mankind, all races would be represented.”</p>

<p>Hooton, another scientist, is even more emphatic.
He declares that “each racial type runs
the gamut from idiots and criminals to geniuses
and statesmen. No type produces a majority of
individuals from either end of the scale. There
are no racial monopolies of either human virtues
or vices.”</p>

<p>Carefully controlled intelligence tests given by
educators and scientists to different racial groups
show that, where environment and social conditions
are the same, no group can claim mental
superiority. In fact, it has been clearly apparent
that “man, everywhere, is basically and fundamentally
similar” and that his differences, be
they physical, mental, or moral, are determined
not by race so much as by the social conditions
and opportunities around him.</p>

<h3><i>Important Findings</i></h3>

<p>The assimilation of different groups within the
United States would seem to show that:</p>

<p><b><i>1. Under favorable conditions of equal opportunity,
all racial groups, whatever their original
homeland conditions and status, are capable of
rapid social change both as individuals and as
groups.</i></b></p>

<p>“It can easily be shown,” says one scientist,
“how dependent mental differences are upon
social conditions. For instance, exact observations
have been made on Negroes who have
moved from the country to the city and it has
been shown that assimilation of these people to
the behavior of the city population takes place
within a few years.</p>

<p>“Likewise, it has been shown in the case of
Italian immigrants that they grow to resemble
the Americans in behavior the longer they have
been in this country, provided they do not remain
isolated. One of the most instructive illustrations
of this assimilation is the ease with which children
adopt the dialect and manner of expression
of their environment.”</p>

<p><b><i>2. All groups, under the stimulus of opportunity
and contact, have capacity to produce
exceptional individuals of high creative ability
or genius and thus help build up and perfect
human culture.</i></b></p>

<p>The Nordic and Slav, the southern European
and Jew, black, white, brown, and yellow have
all produced men and women of outstanding
brains and genius. To confirm these statements
it is only necessary to read, in the pages that
follow, the contributions of the immigrant and
his descendants to American life.</p>

<p>Research studies, conducted on an objective
basis, prove that individual brilliance may be
and is, found in all groups.</p>

<p><b><i>3. Under the influence of a common environment,
physical and cultural, the offspring of
different racial and national groups in a democracy
tend toward a common culture with common
customs and ideals.</i></b></p>

<p>John Dewey has emphasized that, “in a democratic
society, individuals give freely to others
of the peculiar value, essence, quality, and contribution
of the group to which they belong, and
receive freely the corresponding treasures of other
groups, and this without violence to the complete
uniqueness of the group.”</p>

<p>At birth, no individual has any culture and
so the culture he eventually acquires is the one
he finds around him and is capable of assimilating.
However, “new conditions bring the need of
new ideals and new emphasis on certain aspects
of old ideals.” Civilization itself is not only safeguarded
but advanced when a nation, composed
of many races, finds it possible for each racial
group to “function creatively in building the culture
of the race into the whole culture pattern.”</p>

<p><b><i>4. Within the framework of common political
and economic institutions, a variety of cultural
elements makes for a richer and more active
social culture.</i></b></p>

<p>In all history, some of the most advanced civilizations
have been the product of a mixture of cultures.
No great nations or civilizations have been
born in isolation. Inbreeding inevitably results
in one-sidedness and, eventually, in stagnation
and decadence.</p>

<p>Spain was at its greatest “when the mixture of
peoples was at its height.” England grew great
because the ingredients of many racial groups ran
in the Englishman’s blood. The United States
will continue to be great because the intermingling
of many groups tends to build a culture or
civilization that unifies the best of their contributions.</p>

<p><b><i>5. A civilization of many different elements
develops religious, social, and cultural tolerance.
It also creates ability which may permit it to
grow and change.</i></b></p>

<p>Many other persons and organizations added

to inaugurate a plan of broadcasting, Dr. L. R.
Alderman, Specialist in Adult Education, and
for many years an ardent contributor to Americanization
work, urged the use of radio as a
medium for stimulating nation-wide appreciation
of the “cultures of the melting pot”. Mr. W. D.
Boutwell, Director of the radio project of the
Office of Education, was active in developing program
ideas and conferring with Miss Roberta
Newell of the Radio Division of the New York
City Board of Education, W.P.A. Adult Education
Program, about plans and techniques used by
Miss Newell in her radio series, “America Calling”,
which was on the air in the Spring of 1937.</p>

<p>One of the most enthusiastic advocates and supporters
of a comprehensive radio presentation of
the immigrants’ contribution to American life is
Mr. Avenire Toigo, Executive Secretary of the

<p>Dear Listener:</p>

<p>This booklet is presented in sincere appreciation of your interest
in the AMERICANS ALL—IMMIGRANTS ALL radio series.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful for your patience in the face of delay in
getting this booklet to you. When you read it, however, I feel you
will be repaid, for no effort has been spared in making it worthy
of being read and treasured as a permanent record of the AMERICANS
ALL—IMMIGRANTS ALL radio series.</p>

<p>Since the programs themselves could give you only a general panorama
of the many colorful and significant contributions made by
peoples of many races and lands to the building of our Nation, you
will no doubt wish to be in a position to investigate for yourself
some of the things which have impressed you as most interesting.</p>

<p>The suggested readings and sources for more material, given in the
booklet and the special list should help you in doing this. If
this Office can be of further service, please feel free to call
upon us.</p>

<p>As an enthusiastic listener of AMERICANS ALL—IMMIGRANTS ALL, you
will no doubt be glad to learn that these radio programs have been
perpetuated in the form of recordings which can be used on phonographs
and on radio playback equipment. You may wish to give this
news to teachers, club leaders, and others who would have a natural
interest in promoting broader tolerance through understanding. You
may also wish to put into their hands the inclosed reference list.</p>

<p>Thanking you again for your abiding interest, I am</p>

<p class="center">Cordially yours,</p>
